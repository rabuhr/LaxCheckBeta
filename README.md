## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20+ 
- PostgreSQL database
- OpenAI API key (optional, for enhanced analysis)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/laxcheck.git
cd laxcheck
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```

3. **Set up environment variables**
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your database URL and API keys
```

4. **Initialize database**
```bash
npm run db:push
```

5. **Start development server**
```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5000`

### Desktop Application

Build and run the desktop version:

```bash
# Development
npm run electron:dev

# Build for production
npm run electron:build
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables

```env
# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:port/database

# AI Services (Optional)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key

# Development
NODE_ENV=development
SESSION_SECRET=your_session_secret
```

### ML Model

The system includes a pre-trained model with these classes:
- Warrior Blade, Jett, Evolution series
- Brine Edge, Cyber, Vapor series  
- STX Excalibur, SAM II
- Nike Blur, Reebok 6K
- Vintage and rare collector pieces
- Unknown (fallback class)

To train a custom model:
1. Collect 15+ photos per lacrosse head model
2. Use [Google Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/)
3. Export as TensorFlow.js
4. Replace files in `/model/` directory

## 📱 Deployment

### Web Deployment (Replit)

1. **Deploy to Replit**
   - Import from GitHub repository
   - Set environment variables in Secrets
   - Deploy using Replit's deployment system
